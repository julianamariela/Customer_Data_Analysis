# Customer Data Analysis

## Overview
This project revolves around an in-depth analysis of customer data sourced from the Adventure Works Data Warehouse (ADW), serving as the project's primary data source. AHG, a company associated with the Adventure Works data warehouse, aims to extract valuable insights to inform strategic decisions in marketing and sales. The project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data, ultimately contributing to AHG's business growth.

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To determine the influence of income on revenue inflow.
- To analyse product categories, sales channels, revenue, profit, and quantities, leading to informed decision-making.
- To create customer profiles for each income segment, aiding in targeted marketing efforts.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. ##### Data Collection and SQL Import:
   The Adventure Works Data Warehouse (ADW) is the foundational data source. Data collection involves importing the ADW into SQL, where specific queries are crafted to extract relevant insights.
   - Customer Segmentation Query: This query segments customers based on income levels and identifies educational qualifications tied to each segment. It investigates whether the number of children impacts purchasing behavior and explores geographic distribution's influence on revenue.
   - Product Channel Query: Split into two parts, this query focuses on two sales channels, fetching data on products, categories, and sales metrics.
3. ##### Data Analysis and Visualization in Power BI:
   The SQL-generated tables are imported into Power BI for analysis. Dashboards are created to visualize findings, including:
   - Customer Profile Visualization: Insights into ideal customer profiles for each segment.
   - Customer Segmentation Visualization: Visual representation of customer segmentation and income distribution.
   - Key Influencers Analysis: Identification of factors influencing purchasing behavior.
   - Channel Comparison Visualization: Comparative analysis of sales channels' performance.
5. ##### Report Creation:
   Ideal customer profiles are designed in PDF format, succinctly summarizing each customer segment's key characteristics.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Power BI: Utilized for data visualization, creating dashboards and reports.
- SQL: Employed to import, manipulate, and structure data for analysis.
- PDF: Used to create customer profiles in a shareable format.
